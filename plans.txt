THE PLAN
(will be updated)


products many types: novelties, cakes(small multishot, large multishot, 500g) rockets, fountains, roman candles, closeouts, shells, and supplies

managers have one order, one inventory, and one information


the following needs to be shown on the products page:
cakes, novelties, small multishot, large multishots, rockets, fountains, roman candles
QUOTE FROM RICH: "when you click on Products, then click cakes, then click 500 gram.  Choose one of the items on that page.  Gives you info and you can click on and see a movie video of item."

we need to have a control panel page that allows addding/ and removing products (form with picture/video)


we also need a "manager page" with user authentification where each manager has one order and
each order contains many products
the manager page also needs to allow them to press a button and set their "order status" to ok or whatever to show that their order was shipped how they were supposed to get it.

the main welcome page will contain a google map with all of the locations on it, http://www.sitepoint.com/use-google-maps-rails/ and there will be a locations page as well and there needs to be a place in the control panel place that will allow the addition of locations
